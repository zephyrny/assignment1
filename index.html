          <p class="header__summary">Polishing off <em>the last few shrines</em> and giving Calamity Ganon what — for in the final battle of <strong> <a href="https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/" target="Breath of the wild"> (っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </a></strong> was a bittersweet act. After such a wonderful, rich journey it was time to bid farewell to Link, Zelda and the largest, most expansive iteration of Hyrule we'd ever visited — what were we going to do with ourselves?</p>
          <p class="header__summary">Of course, we returned to devour the DLC and burn across the kingdom on our motorcycle while vacuuming up several hundred Korok seeds, but then began the wait for the next " proper " Zelda game. Sure, in the intervening time we've had <em><strong>Cadence of Hyrule</strong></em>, the <em><strong>Link's Awakening</strong></em> remake, the <em><strong>Skyward Sword</strong></em> remake, and <em><strong>Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Calamity</strong></em>, and there are plenty of <em><strong>Zelda — like games available for Switch</strong></em>, but there's nothing quite like a full — fat Zelda experience.</p>
          <p class="header__summary">We already knew that <em><span class="hover-word">a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild was in development,</span></em> after Nintendo revealed it during their <strong>E3 2019 Direct presentation</strong>. But after E3 2020 was cancelled, we didn't get another peek at the game until <strong>Nintendo's E3 2021 Direct presentation</strong>.</p>

          <p class="header__summary">In March 2022, the game was delayed to Spring 2023, as the series producer Eiji Aonuma took to Twitter to announce further delays... and a ( very short ) clip of the game! Then, in September 2022, <em>Nintendo finally announced a name — </em><strong> ✿✿ヽ(ﾟ▽ﾟ)~✿ Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </strong> — and a solid release date: May 12th, 2023. Clear that day in your calendar, pals.</p>

          <p class="header__summary">We're not really sure. Link seems to be in it, Zelda's in it ( for a bit, at least ), plus a dead guy that looks like Ganondorf, and a Hyrule that has been torn up, with many new islands being launched into the sky by... something. Something bad, presumably. And there are tears... of the... uh... kingdom. Whatever that means.</p>

          <p class="header__summary"><em><strong>Is it set in the same world as Breath of the Wild? </strong></em></p>
          <p class="header__summary">Yes and no. The Hyrule below seems very similar, but the islands above seem new — they're covered in yellow foliage and temples we've never seen before. There's also evidence of caves we haven't yet explored... but otherwise, a lot of the world does seem very similar. It's up to you whether that's a good or bad thing!</p>
          <p class="header__summary"><em><strong>Is it a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild?</strong></em></p>
          <p class="header__summary">Hard to say. It was, for a long time, called " the Sequel to Breath of the Wild ", and some trailers have shown Link and Zelda looking more or less like their BOTW versions... but there are also plenty of elements that could take place before BOTW, too. So who knows!</p>
          <p class="header__summary"><em><strong>Is there DLC?</strong></em></p>
          <p class="header__summary">Slow your Eponas, pal! The game's not even out yet! But... we'd venture a guess at " yes ". Eventually.</p>
          <p class="header__summary"><em><strong>Is Zelda dead?</strong></em></p>
          <p class="header__summary">She might be. That would be a bit of a bummer.</p>

          <p class="header__summary">But to summarise what we learned for certain from this latest trailer that we didn't already know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The release date is the 12th May, 2023.</li>
              <li>The title is " Tears of the Kingdom ".</li>
              <li>Link has a new glider.</li>
              <li>There are seven... somethings. Tears? Dungeons? Bosses? Collectibles? We don't know.</li>
              <li>Link's time — rewinding power is important and usefu.</li>
              <li>Link can still climb, run, and dive.</li>
              <li>Hyrule is messed up.</li>
              <li>The terrain has changed from BOTW.</li> 
              <li>There are dragons in the logo.</li> 
              <li>Link has some new equipment — strange teal vials on his belt.</li>
              <li><strong>Not much, still: </strong></li>
            </ul>
                <p class="header__summary"><img class="bottom__image02" src="https://images.hdqwalls.com/wallpapers/princess-zelda-4k-js.jpg" alt="Princess Zelda"> ◆ <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/eiji_aonuma_on_returning_to_the_hyrule_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild" target="Eiji Aonuma"> <strong>(っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ Eiji Aonuma talked</strong></a> about the team's desire to return to the established Hyrule from Breath of the Wild and to incorporate new gameplay and story in that world; this grew from <em><strong>an overabundance of ideas for DLC.</strong></em> He specifically called it a " continuation " of Breath of the Wild, so this is definitely the same Zelda and Link we've known for the past four years.</p>
                <p class="header__summary">◆ The sequel is being directed by Hidemaro Fujibayashi, the same man who took the wheel on the previous game ( as well as several previous entries in the series ). Fujibayashi reportedly took inspiration from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim" target="Skyrim"> <strong>(っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ Skyrim</strong></a> while developing Breath of the Wild, and series boss Aonuma confirmed that many of <em><span class="hover-word">the younger staff on this sequel have been playing</span></em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/zelda_breath_of_the_wild_sequel_inspired_by_red_dead_redemption_2_says_aonuma" target="Red Dead Redemption 2"> <strong>(っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ Red Dead Redemption 2,</strong></a> although how that will manifest in the final product is still unknown at the moment.</p>
                <p class="header__summary">◆ Eiji Aonuma also said <em>this entry in the series will be darker,</em> so more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask" target="Majora's Mask"> <strong>(っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ Majora's Mask</strong></a> than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap" target="Minish Cap"> <strong>(っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ Minish Cap.</strong></a></p>

                <p class="header__summary">♫ Unlike the first part, the game will be linear at the beginning. Canonically, Link already knows Hyrule, so there is no point in climbing the towers again.</p>
                <p class="header__summary">♫ Instead, the developers have filled the world with a miasmic version of Ganon, and until the infection is cleared from location to location, it will be impossible to move around the entire Hyrule.</p>
                <p class="header__summary">♫ In this regard, the locations are worked out much deeper than in the original. At the very least, McVicker hints at the appearance of dungeons, strongly inspired by one game that knows a lot about spreading dungeons around the open world.</p>
                <p class="header__summary">♫ In general, while designing the world of Breath of the Wild 2, developers was inspired by Red Dead Redemption 2 ( officially known ) and another unknown game.</p>
